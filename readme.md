## Introduction

This document describes a basic File Server application written in Go. The server listens for incoming connections on port 3000 and simulates sending and receiving files.

1. Dependencies

The code utilizes the following Go packages:
```
 - bytes: Provides functions for manipulating byte slices.
 - crypto/rand: Provides functions for generating random data.
 - fmt: Provides formatting functions for output.
 - io: Provides functions for general input and output operations.
 - log: Provides logging functionality.
 - net: Provides functions for network communication.
 - time: Provides functions for manipulating time values.
```
2. Code Structure

The code is organized into the following parts:

* FileServer struct: This struct defines a server object with no fields currently.
* start method: This method starts the server by listening on port 3000 for incoming connections. It accepts connections in an infinite loop and spawns a goroutine for each connection to handle communication.
* readLoop method: This method handles communication for a single incoming connection. It continuously reads data from the connection in a loop, simulating receiving a file. The actual data content is not processed in this example.
* sendFile function: This function simulates sending a file to the server. It generates a random byte slice of a specified size, connects to the server on port 3000, and writes the data to the connection.
* main function: This function is the entry point of the program. It starts the server in a goroutine and then sends a simulated file with a size of 1000 bytes after a 2-second delay.

3. Functionality

* The server listens on port 3000 for incoming connections.
* When a connection is established, the server spawns a separate goroutine to handle communication for that connection.
* The readLoop method continuously reads data from the connection, simulating receiving a file.
* The sendFile function demonstrates sending a simulated file to the server.

4. Limitations

The code currently does not perform any real file operations. It simulates sending and receiving by manipulating byte slices.
Error handling is limited for demonstration purposes. A production-ready server would require more robust error handling.

5. Usage

Compile the code using a Go compiler (e.g., go build).
Run the compiled executable (e.g., ./file_server).
In a separate terminal, run the sendFile function using another Go program or another instance of the same program to simulate sending a file.

6. Future Enhancements

Implement actual file reading and writing functionalities.
Add support for different file formats.
Include proper error handling and logging for robust operation.
Consider adding authentication and authorization mechanisms.

7. Conclusion

This code provides a basic example of a File Server application in Go. It demonstrates concepts like network communication, goroutines, and simulating file transfers. The provided documentation helps understand the code structure and functionality.
